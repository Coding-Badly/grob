//! Welcome to the [grob (growable buffer) crate][gc]!
//!
//! [gc]: https://crates.io/crates/grob
//!
//! Many Windows API functions require the caller to provide a buffer for the returned data.  The
//! pattern goes something like this...
//!
//! * Call the function with an initial buffer and size
//! * If that works then process the returned data
//! * If that does not work because the buffer is too small then create a larger buffer and try again
//! * If that does not work for any other reason then deal with the error
//!
//! There are copious examples of a growable buffer including a version in the Rust Standard
//! Library.  There is a lack of consistency amoungst all the examples.  Some versions continue
//! trying indefinately.  Some versions make an arbitrary number of attempts like three then give
//! up.  Some versions double the size of the new buffer.  Some versions increase the size by a
//! fixed amount like 128 bytes.  Even Microsoft's API examples are inconsistent.
//!
//! The goal with this crate is to provide a single high quality growable buffer that any Rust
//! developer can easily use.
//!
//! # Getting Start
//!
//! The [generic functions](#functions) listed below are a great place to start.  They wrap all the
//! details necessary for making Windows API calls.
//!
//! | When the API Call Returns | And the Data Is | For Example                             | Use                                     |
//! | ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
//! | an error code; a [`u32`]  | large + binary  | [`GetTcpTable2`][4]                     | [`winapi_large_binary`] + [`RvIsError`] |
//! | an error code; a [`u32`]  | large + binary  | [`GetAdaptersAddresses`][1]             | [`winapi_large_binary`] + [`RvIsError`] |
//! | a [`BOOL`][b]             | small + binary  | [`GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx`][2] | [`winapi_small_binary`] + [`RvIsError`] |
//! | a [`BOOL`][b]             | text            | [`GetUserNameW`][5]                     | [`winapi_string`] + [`RvIsError`]       |
//! | elements / WCHARs stored  | path            | [`GetModuleFileNameW`][3]               | [`winapi_path_buf`] + [`RvIsSize`]      |
//! | elements / WCHARs stored  | path            | [`GetSystemWindowsDirectoryW`][6]       | [`winapi_path_buf`] + [`RvIsSize`]      |
//! | bytes stored              | large + binary  | [`GetFileVersionInfoSizeW`][7]          | [`winapi_large_binary`] + [see example][e] |
//!
//! [`WindowsString`] and [`WindowsPathString`] are available for easily and efficiently passing
//! string parameters into Windows API functions like [`DeleteFileW`][df], [`ReplaceFileW`][rf], and
//! [`SetComputerNameW`][scn].
